# Huffman-File-Compressor

The goal of this assignment is to create a compressor that reads in a file, then produces
a compressed set of characters that can be decompressed into the original file (reducing file size by approximately 1/2).
The mechanism used to implement this is mainly based upon binary tree separation into nodes of 0s and 1s.
